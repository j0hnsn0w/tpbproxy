Dear whatever-you-are,
thank you for providing us and our users with such great entertainment.
I'm not talking about Enya (hey, Enya fucking sucks), but instead of your
nonsensical email.

You have
- confused us with our ISP
- no knowledge whatsoever about BitTorrent
- no knowledge whatsoever of the appliciable laws (trademark or copyright)
- made very entertaining threats (hey, go ahead and contact RIPE NCC,
please, I beg you)

You have scored 10 out of 10 points on our Legal Threats Entertainment
scale. You win the grand prize: A lifetime of ridicule on our legal
threats section (http://static.thepiratebay.org/legal/) !
Congratulations!

Please also note that I'm not currently out of toilet paper, so you may
wait a while before sending legal papers.
