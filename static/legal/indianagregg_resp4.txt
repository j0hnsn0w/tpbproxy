Dear Peter,

I'm referring to the Digital Millineum Copyright act.   We have tracked over 250 thousand downloads of the album  in question on torrent sites globally.  Many of the sites
have removed the link as per our request over the past year.   Your reluctancy to remove the link is incomprehensible.   Happily you aren't as popular as Minnova and bit-torrent.  I am simply requesting that you remove the URL 
link to the torrent.    I am giving you notice as to prevent any copyright infringement.  

As you are aware , the DMCA, does not grant blanket protection from copyright infringement liability.  The service provider may not take advantage of the DMCA's safe harbor provision if:

  1.  The service provider has actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;
  2.  The service provider is aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or
  3.   The service provider does not expeditiously remove or disable access to the material upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness of the infringing material.

In addition, if the service provider has the right and ability to control the infringing activity and if the service provider receives a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, the service provider 
will not be protected by Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  If the service provider satisfies the above requirements of the DMCA and receives a proper notice of infringing material, the service provider must 
expeditiously remove or disable access to the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. 

I am a millionaire and do not claim to be bankrupt.  Your opinion is not necessary or relevent to my request that you remove the URL.

Thank you,

Indiana Gregg

Oh my, this is such a treat. You keep on surprising me with more and more displays of stupidity.

Let's go back to the basics.
1) TPB follows Swedish law, the country where we live
2) DMCA is an american law
3) Sweden is not a part of the United States
4) TPB has no connection to United States and hence does not follow US law

Is that understood? Ok, great.

1) You say to us that we must remove a link, although it's legal and we have a purpose of letting people link stuff, because it's what we like
2) You say it's "incomprehensible" when we refuse to follow orders from someone not relevant to us nor our users
3) You say our opinion is not necessary nor relevant and we must do what you say? What kind of fascist are you?
If someone you met on the streets told you to stop wearing brown because their father tries to patent the color, would you do it? You would of course laugh. Just as we're laughing at you (not with you).

Also, very happy for you that you're a millionaire. In an earlier e-mail you said you're close to bankruptcy because of us, so I foolishly believed ya. But glad you proved your lies yet again.

Btw, being the second biggest search engine in the world is good enough for us. We don't need to be higher ranked than Mininova on alexa (although we actually have more visitors than they have). We're glad to be the seriously 
biggest file sharing system in the world ever, that sites like Mininova can use in order to let people share. That's our goal and we reached it. And we're continuing to grow.

Peter
