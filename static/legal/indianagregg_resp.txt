Ian,

is it possible to authorise something to be an illegal download? That would be a legal download if it would be authorised now, wouldn't it. Also, i've never heard of "legal copyright" (nor illegal copyright for that matter). 
I think you need to re-check your intentions of the e-mail and try again. We do not respond to messages that do not make 100% perfect sense. You're confused.
