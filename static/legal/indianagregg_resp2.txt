subject	Response From a Pirate Torrent Site - Something has to be done now ! ......Re: TPB: Legal threats

Dear Peter,

In the UK ( and most other countries) file sharing by torrent or otherwise is illegal... full stop.  

The original email was from the artist, on the company address yes, but not from me.... how does that make you feel ?

Having sat on cross parliamentary committees, resolved to regenerating music and culture in my country, i'm afraid you may just have picked the wrong person to cross swords with on this occasion.

The illegal file sharing of the Indiana Gregg album ' Woman At Work' , with us now having currently had over 250K + full album downloads removed from torrent sites, has almost bankrupted our company and sadly the artist and 
myself personally,  not to mention many other small independent labels and artists worldwide. 

As we both know she is currently # 1 in various myspace charts around the globe in her genre's  and  you are making money by stealing from us, if we were to do the same in a different genre i.e....  walk into the bakers shop 
and walk out with all the cream cakes and 'share' them with people on the street we would be very quickly arrested.     

The law needs to..  and soon will be applied to people like you.  In fact I correct myself, the law is there, it just needs applied.

Do you share any revenues from your site ( advertising or otherwise) with the people that u steal the goods you supply from ?  

For the avoidance of doubt, that would be the.. the artist, the musicians, the writers, producer / studio engineers etc etc who all make a living from what you steal.
 
I hope the relevant societies and people I copy your reply to,  take action to shut down your illegal operations for good.

You and people like you are destroying the music industry,  taking away any chance a developing artist has of fulfilling any aspirations whatsoever  they or their fans may have for your own illegal financial gain.

Thanks for your IP Address and Server / Routing details

Regards...... Ian

You're a hoot, that's what you are :)
I want to hug you in a non-sexual way and tell you that you make my heart burst of joy and cuddle up like a cute little cookie monster and ask for more milk.

... and btw, to be in a business you have very little knowledge on what you're doing. I would actually see you as a retard, but it's hard when you're so cuddly and manly! I wish I was just 20 years older and a girl... oh my..

Hugs n kisses,
Your eternal friend,
Peter
