thanks for repeating the sites name, I didn't understand the first time.
Governmental viewing level 3? Is this the final level? what's the boss like in this level? I remember playing
Gradius 2(aka Life Force, aka Salamander, aka best shoot em up ever!!1 no it's not! yes it is! we
dont agree with myself) and on one level there was this huuuge brain with eyes and arms!! I almost dreamt nightmares
about that. luckily I ebeat his ass using the konami code. since then, I've been having serious knightmares about
that brain. just last week I saw this guy walking down the street who looked like a brain (I knows! craaazy!) and I
desperately searched for my NES controller. I didnt know if the guy had the power of lazors or not, but there waz no time to
ask. I finally found the controller in my bag (just under some rugged copies of 2600, a crappy print out of The Coming
Insurrection, a roll of tinfoil and a note with the phone number to a really nice guy I met last night at a bar in a
town I forgot the name of  but he had blue eyes and cool shoes just the right type ya know but smelled funky.
Anyway, I pressed Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A and booom! I felt the power of Greyskull flow
through my veins. It was AWESOOOOOOME! Thanks to some previous power bars I now too had the power of laz0rs.
I quickly strafe-jumped to the left, then to the right and then to the right again while screaming Pew! pew! pew!
Nah! Nah! Nah! Peeew! (that gives more power to my lazors and usually defeats even the most annoying bosses and their
bosses bosses). Mr Brain then looked at me with pain and confusion in his eyes, clearly the lazors were working! When
he turned around (probably scared to death!) I quickly jumped behind a crate, reloading my lazors and stood ready if
the brain dude were to return. He didn't. Lucky for him mkey1 I wouldn't wanna turn on my god mode just like that.
So dont think that some level 3 bullshit will scare me. As I've just subliminally (you might wanna google that) told
you, I can deal with any level of bullshit. Yes i can, no i can't but i do!

I could go on a rant here about how no material is kept on our servers, and nowadays not even the torrents, and how
none of the material passes through our servers, and so on and so on. But since we keep on getting these crazy mails
from people like you, I won't bother.
But, on (a) I'll reply
Europol? More like Eurolol! Lololololol!!1 hahahaha ok we very funny
and on (b) I'll reply
Yeah good luck with that. Ask your buddies at the MPAA, RIAA, MAFIAA and the american justice department how much effect
that usually does. We got raided once due the american government going to bed with the swedish gov and some pillowtalking
into an agreement about shutting us down. We were down for 3 days. Not as much of a problem comparing to how long it took
us to get online when a former admin went on a drunk rampage and was nowhere to be found (down for 5 days. some million in
fines, 4 dead sheep and a story never to be told, without level 4 clearance.. yeah, more than you have, you're only at level 3
lolololol)

Hey your're welcome! Feel free to grab some retractable batons on your way out. If the MPAA didn't grab em all.

I'm all good, but our users might have some questions, so you should
