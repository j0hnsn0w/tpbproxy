Dear Peter,

re: 5th attempt .... requesting removal of copyright material: As there seems to be confusion about the intention of our numerous requests for the removal of our copyright material from your piratebay torrent site over the past 
year. I would like to clarify and reiterate my request that you take down the link to a torrent download of my album. "Woman At Work" The URL: http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3664298/Indiana_Gregg_-_Woman_At_Work_(2007)_-_Pop As 
you are fully aware, the law does not condone sharing of copyright material on torrent sites and you are required by law to remove content (that you are being made aware of) that is being shared illegally as the operator of 
your site. Just to clarify...the album is the LEGAL COPYRIGHT of Gr8pop Ltd (yes, Legal copyright is a term used in law.... sorry, that you have never heard of it. I suppose you will very very soon.) Illegal file sharing of 
copyright material is indeed copyright infringement and it is your legal responsibility to remove that content upon request from the owner of that copyright. Why you would take such a bold step as to actually 'argue' with a 
copyright owner who is requesting their material to be removed is, in my opinion, hazardous to your illegal business.  

(considering your email below to Mr. Ian Morrow, it is obvious that you are attempting to avoid our request via forms of insult and malicious humor both of which are unecessary and likewise hazardous.)

It's obvious that you don't care about our independent request and are in the midst of defending yourself legally radically this year already....... so, wouldn't it be easier for you to just take down the url at our request and 
get on with life?

Dear Indy,

As you are apparently _not_ aware of - YOUR LAW IS NOT MY LAW. We live in a country where it's totally LEGAL to have torrent files up on a site. Actually, I doubt that it's illegal in your country as well - but apparently you 
can't grasp the concept of torrent files but you still try to act like a lawyer with full knowledge. It's "hazardous" to claim something to be illegal when it's totally legal and I would refrain from being a stupid asshole in 
your situation.
Also interesting is that even though there are noone sharing that torrent what-so-ever I would more guess that you're close to bancrupcy because of either crappy marketing skills, crappy musical taste, or even your proven 
crappy legal skills. It has nothing to do with the torrent community.

I'm arguing is that we have none of your content on our site. We have a torrent file which points to content, which is a totally different thing. We have never removed a single torrent because of a companys request and we will 
not start doing it now. Especially not for someone who is so blatently ignorant towards globality and laws in different regions.

I would also like to point out that you made the legal threats section of our webpage with your previous e-mail. http://thepiratebay.org/legal
It's something to be proud of I guess.

Peter
