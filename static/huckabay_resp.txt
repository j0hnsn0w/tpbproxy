Wow, that's a lot of text to read. You like to brag, don't you? "I am the owner",
"I am the president" and so forth. That's very nice. We don't really care.
I'm the president of my make-believe country The Pirate Islands. Oh, and I'm the
owner of my old Peugeot 205 (1989 year model) as well. Once we filmed that car
while I was driving. I guess I'm the owner of those tapes as well. So we have
ALOT in common! That's nice. But you brag about it, that's so not cool! :(

>ThePirateBay.org has posted and is permitting downloads of an illegal

They are? I seriously doubt that they actually posted that torrent. I guess some
of those fellons using that evil site posted it, darn :(

Hey wait a minute, this isn't a Copyright claim now is it? This looks more like
a personal ad! How about checking out some of the local press instead of trying
to pick up people in other continents? Actually, being in different countries
(even on different continents) means that we don't have the same laws here.
You know, in Sweden, it's still legal to do a lot of things. Elks can have sex
with eachother without being prosecuted for instance. And people are allowed
to copy. It's quite natural, both of them, don't you think?

You write with big letters, it make my head hurt. Come again, you're sending
us an e-mail telling us how wrong you are?

In sweden we had a cool tv-show once. It was called "Vi i femman" (means
something like "we in the fifth grade") and it was a lot like your letter.
People answer questions about meaningless stuff. I'd like to answer like them!

On a) our answer is; "pannkaka" (google for it), and on b) we answer "congratulations".
Regarding c) our answer would have to be "hope you like the site" and on d) 
"we understand your desperate needs".
Wow, a lot of questons, let's continue:
Our answer on both e) and f) is that we don't really have any faith in you, nor
do we actually believe that you are who you say you are. Can you please
send us a signed picture of yourself?

As a bonus answer on d) we would like to help you out, we understand the
severe problem you must have finding other men like yourself when you actually
try to hook up with random people in another continent like this!
So please go to http://thepiratebay.org/ and login. We have a quite large
porn section I guess, and since we are of such high moral we actually filter
the section for non-logged in users. So register (it's free!) and check it out!

>2.  It is now PRQ.se's legal responsibility to to remove or disable
>access to http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3439729 , where my
>copyrighted WORK is being infringed.  Further, should this material be
>posted again on thepiratebay.org's site, while PRQ.se is
>thepiratebay.org's hosting service, we will be obliged to take legal
>action against both parties at that time.

Uuuuuhh.. no it's not. We don't infringe on anything, now you're getting a bit
too personal here! We might start to cry when you threaten us, and we don't
have anyone to take care of us. Is that your mighty plan?

>3.  CONSIDER THIS TO BE APPROPRIATE EMAIL NOTIFICATION, PURSUANT TO
>COPYRIGHT CLAIMS IN THE DMCA AND PRQ.se'S OWN POLICIES.  NOW IT IS
>PRQ.se'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FORWARD THIS WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO
>THEPIRATEBAY.ORG, THE INFRINGER, AND TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS PROMPTLY
>TO NOTIFY THE INFRINGER THAT IT HAS REMOVED OR DISABLED ACCESS TO MY
>COPYRIGHTED WORK'S MATERIAL (
>http://thepiratebay.org/details.php?id=3439729 ).

Consider this to be a letter that replies "fuck you" in an ironic yet subtle way.
Oh, damn, i just wrote it straight out!

Sincerely,
The Pirate Bay crew
presidents and owners, The Pirate Islands AND A 1989 Peugeot 205 GTI (the one with
the large engine) and copyright holders (*fnizz*) of the movies we shot during some
driving with it.

yet retarded threats? Those bastards!!! Hey, make sure that YOU don't end up on
http://thepiratebay.org/legal.php yourself, that would be so wrong of them, wouldn't
it? And yes, probably a letter like this is just what is needed to bring down the
site, you are a copyright hero! WOW! Plz send us that signed photo asap so we can
put it up alongside a text saying "site closed by Tim J Huckabay" on the frontpage!
