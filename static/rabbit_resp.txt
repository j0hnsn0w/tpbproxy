Dear Mr Rabbitt, (Why the extra T? Afraid of furry-jokes when paying
with your credit card? Or does the rabbit suit give you away?)

Even though we deeply respect and acknowledge your "intellectual"
property, we fail to see how an interpretation of the said directives
makes them applicable in this case.
NONE of the copyrighted data in question is published or ever stored on
our servers. Nor is any of the copyrighted data relayed through our
servers. The tracker merely provides .torrent files.
As to this day this activity is not prohibited by Swedish law and it's
our assessment that not even a wide interpretation of the E-commerce
directives makes them applicable to torrent trackers. Out activities
will therefore continue until this fact changes or Hell freezes over. 

We suggest that you motion for a change of Swedish and/or for the
European Supreme Court to clarify the interpretation of the directive,
which should take no more than 3-7 years. Patience is a virtue!

In the meantime: Enjoy our tracker! If you browse under "porn" I'm sure
that you'll find something that tickles just that "special" spot. 
Hope to see you at the annually furry-convention in Las Vegas! Our whole
staff will be going as the cast from the movie "Homeward Bound: The
Incredible Journey"

Sincerely
