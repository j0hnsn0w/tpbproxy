This gives a cause of action and jurisdiction to sue you in the UK. Our client would then proceed to enforce the UK judgement against you in Sweden.

Dear Prokaryote(s),

Please sue me in Japan instead. I've always wanted to visit Tokyo.
Also, I'm running out of toilet paper, so please send lots of legal documents
to our ISP - preferably printed on soft paper.
No, but seriously. That's simply not how international law enforcement
works. Using the same logic, a country where web sites are forbidden could
press charges against you for having one.
