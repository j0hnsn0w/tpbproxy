"First Notice of Infringement"? Is that kind of like when I don't pay my
bills on time? "First notice", "Second notice", "Third notice", "WE KILL
YOU!", then a package with the sawed-off head of a pig?

We already know our own postal address - you don't have to inform us of
it.

IMMEDIATELY STOP SCREAMING. You may also consider not using red,
underlined HTML.

Sorry, but I can't remove search.php - our users would get upset if TPB
suddenly lacked a search function. 
The problem here seems to be that the material is unreleased? If that is
the case, you can easily fix the problem by releasing it. We'll be more
than glad to help you distribute it - free of charge! - to our users.

You should understand that your email and all further communication with
us will be published at http://thepiratebay.org/legal.php , and that we
will charge you for the web publishing and hosting services. Should I
send the invoice to your address above?

We are well aware of the fact that The Pirate Bay falls outside the
scope of the DMCA - after all, the DMCA is a US-specific legislation,
and TPB is hosted in the land of vikings, reindeers, Aurora Borealis and
cute blonde girls.

So it's OK with you if we bring legal action against you for 
a) claiming that we host any infringing files, which we don't,
b) claiming that DMCA has any relation what so ever to the activites of
the site,
and
c) making my eyes bleed by writing in UPPERCASE, underlined, and red
text?

I fixed the typo for you.
