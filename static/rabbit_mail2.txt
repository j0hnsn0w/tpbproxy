(Actually the extra 't' has always been there. I suppose I could ask  
the elders of the family why it was added, but most of them have  
passed on, and the remaining few don't like talking to the younger  
generation.)

With regard to the situation at hand, I'll take your advice and  
contact the EC directly. I don't expect much, I just don't want to  
lose any more sales to the person called 'evilsibe'. We've been able  
to shut down many trackers who don't actually host our materials  
under the 'made available' clause of the US DMCA; but this is an  
international case, so the laws of the US don't hold water - nor  
should they.
