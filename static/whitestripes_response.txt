We would like to refer you to our Legal Threats section, on which we,
while having much fun, ridicule people like you.
Thank you for your contribution.

...and I would like to refer you to the relevant court cases.
Unfortunately, our legal team partied quite heavily last night, so the
only reference I can provide you with is Högsta Domstolen (the Swedish
Supreme Court) NJA I 1996 page 79.

Damnit. You got us there. Now I'm so scared I pissed my pants. Where
should I send the invoice for cleaning them?

Wow, we have something in common! See, I also have obligations of my
own. For example, I'm obliged to provide entertainment to our users.

You mean our non-commercial, loss-generating activities?

Do you seriously believe that these parties aren't already aware of the
site? You may want to read Swedish media...

We look forward to receiving more of your so exquisitely designed HTML
e-mails with the shiny wanna-be-police-star.

We trust, in this regard, that you will concur that publishing your
e-mail is not in violation of Swedish copyright law. When our lawyer's
hangover has passed, he will be more than happy to explain the juicy

You also have the right to institute sodomizing of yourself. Preferably
with barbed wire, but retractable batons might also work if you push
them far enough.

I wanna be a cool WEB SHERIFF when I grow up. Do I get a shiny star and
