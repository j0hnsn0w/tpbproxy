You are repeating yourself

Let me quote my previous response:
"You should understand that your email and all further communication with

will charge you for the web publishing and hosting services. Should I
send the invoice to your address above?"

So, where should I send the invoice? Our standard web publishing fee is 10E (or USD 15) per e-mail, plus
an invoicing/S&H fee of 1E per invoice. 
If you decide to continue using our web publishing services, ask us about our great bulk rates!
