Dear Sir(s), Madam(s), and/or Slimemold(s),

I have the distinct pleasure of informing you that no Swedish trademark
and/or coypyright law is being violated, regardless of how the situation
may or may not be under UK law. I would advise you to read up on Swedish
trademark law, more specifically Varumarkeslag (1960:644), as this might
save you a great deal of future humiliation.

I would also advise you to
a) not write the subject all in UPPERCASE, as it makes spam filters go
nuts
b) not attach meaningless data from trademark registrys in PDF format
and
c) stop lying.

Then I guess you'll have to send us another oh-so-scary-sounding e-mail
about http://static.thepiratebay.org/sega_mail.txt and
